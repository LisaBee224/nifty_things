#Enneagram site

Working on my HTML skills by building a simple site to showcase
some Enneagram data, one of my favorite personality typologies.

# Resources for the Enneagram
[Eclectic Energies](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/): despite the hokey
name, this is a great and simple site with short descriptions of each of the 
types, and several very good tests to discover your type.

[Enneagram Institute](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-descriptions/):
a more polished and professional site with extensive type descriptions and 
other kinds of media, and offering a free RHETI sampler test to discover your 
type.
