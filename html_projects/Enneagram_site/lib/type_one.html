            <p>This is a paragraph about Type Ones. They are often very 
            critical of themselves and are driven by a need to contain 
            their anger, as though it is a beast inside of them. They are 
            action rather than reflection oriented. This is an unordered
            list of some of the keywords describing Type Ones:

                    <li>Intense</li>
                    <li>Action-oriented</li>
