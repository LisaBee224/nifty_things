        <h2>Type Three</h2>
            <p>This is a paragraph about Type Threes. Type Threes, like Type
            Twos and Fours, are in the Heart center of the Enneagram, and are 
            driven by a need to present a successful image of themselves. 
            consequentially they struggle with knowing who they really are and 
            what they actually feel.</p>
            <br />
            <p> This is a new paragraph. Here's a table of words describing Type Threes:</p>
            <br />
            <table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="2" border="0">
                <tr>
                    <td><i>Row 0 Col 0</i></td>
                    <td><i>Row 0 Col 1</i></td>
                    <td><i>Row 0 Col 2</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><i>Row 1 Col 0</i></td>
                    <td>Hardworking</td>
                    <td>Success-oriented</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
