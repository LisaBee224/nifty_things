# Personal Thinking Styles
Based on various qualitative research, certain thinkers have proposed the concept of the personal "thinking
style"--a description that seeks to concretize the preference individuals have in parsing data.

# Using the quiz 
Download the [lib/quiz.rb](link) file. Create a folder in the same location as the quiz.rb file and name the folder 'quiz_results'.
Run quiz.rb from your terminal/shell; your results will be available in the quiz_results folder.

Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, we also have our 
favorite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and 
instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups:

- Concrete Sequential
- Concrete Random
- Abstract Random
- Abstract Sequential

Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information 
in an ordered, sequential, linear way.

Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters.

Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in 
unstructured, people-oriented environments.
  
Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.

We stress that no thinking style is superior; they are simply different. Each style 
can be effective in its own way. The important thing is that you become more aware of 
which thinking style works best for you. Once you know your own style you can then 
analyze the others. This will help you understand other people better. It will make 
you more flexible. And perhaps we can all pick up tips from each other on how to be 
more effective.

2. After completing the test above:
In the columns below, circle the letters of the words you chose for each number. 
Add your totals for columns I, II, III, and IV. Multiply the total of each column by 4. 
The box with the highest number describes how you most often process information

 	I	II	III	IV
1.	C	D	A	B
2.	A	C	B	D
3.	B	A	D	C
4.	B	C	A	D
5.	A	C	B	D
6.	B	C	A	D
7.	B	D	C	A
8.	C	A	B	D
9.	D	A	B	C
10.	A	C	B	D
11.	D	B	C	A
12.	C	D	A	B
13.	B	D	C	A
14.	A	C	D	B
15.	A	C	B	D

I ___ x 4 =     Concrete Sequential (CS)
II ___ x 4 = 	Abstract Sequential (AS)
III ___ x 4 = 	Abstract Random (AR)
IV ___ x 4 = 	Concrete Random (CR)
