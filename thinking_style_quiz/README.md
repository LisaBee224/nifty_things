Based on various qualitative research, certain thinkers have proposed the concept of the personal "thinking
style"--a description that seeks to concretize the preference individuals have in parsing data.

Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, we also have our 
favorite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and 
instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups:

- Concrete Sequential
- Concrete Random
- Abstract Random
- Abstract Sequential

Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information 
in an ordered, sequential, linear way.

Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters.

Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in 
unstructured, people-oriented environments.
  
Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.

We stress that no thinking style is superior; they are simply different. Each style 
can be effective in its own way. The important thing is that you become more aware of 
which thinking style works best for you. Once you know your own style you can then 
analyze the others. This will help you understand other people better. It will make 
you more flexible. And perhaps we can all pick up tips from each other on how to be 
more effective.
